# Credit Card Customer Segmentation Project

Welcome to the Credit Card Customer Segmentation project repository! This project was completed as part of the "Unsupervised Machine Learning" course at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), under the guidance of our instructor, Shawkat Mohamed.

## Overview
In this project, I utilized various unsupervised learning algorithms to segment credit card customers based on their behaviors and characteristics. By leveraging techniques such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), K-Means Clustering (KMC), Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and Expectation Maximization (EM), we aimed to uncover meaningful patterns in the data without the need for labeled examples.

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Means Clustering (KMC)**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
- **Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)**
- **Expectation Maximization (EM)**

## Project Structure
- **CC GENERAL**: Contains the dataset used for customer segmentation.
- **Clustering_Bank_Customers**: Jupyter notebooks containing the code.
- **README.md**: You're reading it right now!
